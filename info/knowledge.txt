Intent and Context -> https://www.sitepoint.com/customizing-your-api-ai-assistant-with-intent-and-context/

Future scope:
Entities can contain other entities (both system entities and your own developer entities), 
You can set up intents that require certain information and prompt the user if they donâ€™t provide it, 
You can use your previously mentioned entities in a conversation using their $alias

To-Do:
1. Allow logging Comma separated works also
1.1 Ask user if hashtag is correct, show him available 10 hashtags, show him how to create new hashtags
1.2 Ask user if he wants to add any more work for a given hour. Carry one common context to these new intents
1.2 log.work.invitation should be triggered using event rather than dummy user query
1.3 if user declines invitation by saying he is busy or not right now, ask him when should you ping him back
2. @work Intent should only kick in on Context basis, when bot asks every hour
3. Save entire chat segregated by per day basis in DB for study purpose
4. Return Day summary and week summary
4.1 Return summary at EOD and also onDemand
4.2 Summary can be modified by user by user input of say 8am cooking, comma separated. Add is allowed, Delete and Modify not allowed
5. Bot should ask user his preferred time of sleep and time of waking and should not bother user in that time
5.1 Bot should have custom user msg to indicate do not disturb me till 3pm or do not disturb from 3 to 6pm
